# 🏭 Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction using IBM Watsonx AutoAI
This project demonstrates how to use IBM Watsonx AutoAI to automatically build machine learning models for predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) — a numerical value representing air pollution levels — based on historical pollutant and environmental data.

The solution uses Python 3.11 and the ibm-watsonx-ai package to automate the entire ML pipeline, including data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

⚠ Note: This notebook does not include model deployment. It focuses on model development and evaluation using AutoAI.

🎯 Project Objectives
✅ Load and explore air quality data

✅ Set up and run an AutoAI regression experiment

✅ Automatically train and compare multiple ML models

✅ Evaluate model performance (MAE, RMSE, R²)

✅ Generate AQI predictions from new input data
